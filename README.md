What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

Throughout this course we learn about different data structures and algorithms. The goal was to understand what data structure was best to be utilized to complete a certain task. The first four assignments required us to work with vectors, link list, hash tables, and binary trees. With these we would write code to complete a program using one of the mentioned data structures to load and sort bids. We were then tasked with creating psuedocode or a flowchart to better understand the program. The first of the two final projects had us design psuedocode for a vector, hash table, and binary tree for a program we would be creating focusing on college courses and sorting them. We were then asked to create psuedocode for a menu and also psuedocode to sort the file of courses in alphanumeric order. The last part of this project was calculating big O for each data structure and making a recommendation. The second project was all about using what we learned and the data structure choice we recommended to create the code for the program.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

My approach to the problem started with gaining the best understanding of each data structure and the strengths and weaknesses so I could make the best recommendation. All of the data structures function in different ways and making a poor choice can have consequences. This is why it is important to understand data structures and how they work. It may not be the biggest issue if you are working with small amounts of data and make the wrong choice, but when working with lots of data it can be costly if the wrong descision is made. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

This was a challenging, but enjoyable course and the biggest challenge was balancing work and the course workload. The biggest help during this course was understanding the more research I did the better I would understand the problems. If I had an issue I utilized platforms like Stackoverflow.com and YouTube.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

I believe anytime you challenge yourself and problems arise you develop new ways to hand problems that arise in the future. We are always learning and that includes how to problem solve in different ways.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Yes, the final project and assignments before it helped be gain a better understanding on how to write clean reusable could that is easy to understand. Quility comments are always helpful.
